# You can find the default configuration variables in `provisioning/variables.tf`.
# To override the default configuration variables first copy this file and rename it e.g. `cluster.tfvars`.
# Then, from the parent folder, pass to terraform the `cluster.tfvars` file with the flag `terraform apply -var-file=conf/cluster.tfvars`.
# This will apply the configuration with the updated variables.
# 
# For example, to increase the number of compute nodes to 3 uncomment the following line:
# num_compute_nodes = 3
